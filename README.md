<h1>Dataset</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The dataset is comprised of Stathletes-tracked hockey event data, as well as player tracking data generated from broadcast video. The included events have been translated from Stathletes’ raw data to enhance accessibility and interpretability. The various event types include shots, plays, takeaways, puck recoveries, dump ins, dump outs, zone entries, faceoffs and penalties. Event definitions may slightly differ from other sources. For each event, expanded details are provided and the relevant skaters and teams involved are indicated when necessary.</p>

<h2>Tracking Data</h2>

Tracking Data Definitions: 
1. Image Id: A unique identifier for the game from which the player data was extracted 
2. Period: Period of the game  
3. Game Clock: Game Clock of the game 
4. Player or Puck: “Player” if the row refers to a player, “Puck” if the row refers to the puck 
5. Team: One of “Home”, “Away”, or “n/a” (if the puck) 
6. Player Id: The ID or jersey number of the tracked player. Every row for a specific Player Id will have the same jersey number. Player Jersey 
Number is blank if the tracked player’s jersey number couldn’t be identified. 
7. Rink Location X (Feet), Rink Location Y (Feet)
8. Rink Location Z (Feet): This column is always “1” for players and “0.02” for the puck, other than when a goal is scored. When a goal is scored, it’s the 
“Z” position of the puck (how high off the ice the puck is, in feet). 
9. Goal Score: If a goal is scored, this column will be “G” for 1 “Puck” row around when the puck enters the goal. For all other rows, it will be empty.  

<br>

<h2>Shifts Data</h2>

Shifts Data Definitions: 
1.  Date: Date of the game
2.  game_name: ID of the game
3.  team_name: ID of the team
4.  Player_Id: ID of the player
5.  shift_number: Shift number (in increasing order) for each player
6.  period: Period of the shift (range from 1-3 for regulation, 4+ for overtime)
7.  start_clock: Starting clock time of the shift (e.g. ‘19:34’. Format = ‘mm:ss’)
8.  end_clock: Ending clock time of the shift (e.g. ‘19:34’. Format = ‘mm:ss’)
9.  shift_length: Duration of the shift (e.g. ‘19:34’. Format = ‘mm:ss’)
